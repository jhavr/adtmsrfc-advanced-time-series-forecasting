# Advanced Time Series Forecasting with LSTM and Explainable AI

## Overview
This project demonstrates:

- **Synthetic multivariate time series generation** with trend, seasonality, and noise
- **Multi-step forecasting** using an LSTM neural network
- **Explainable AI (SHAP)** analysis for feature importance
- **Baseline comparison** using a classical SARIMAX model

The goal is to **forecast future values accurately** while understanding **which features contribute most** to the predictions.
